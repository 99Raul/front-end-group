# Code Share App

## Project Deployment

This project was deployed using GitHub Pages.

https://99raul.github.io/front-end-group/

## Project Description

Application where users can post and share code snippets. Users can post their own code snippets to save for future use and ease of accessability. Instead of digging through old projects and assignments to find a certain function you wrote, it could be saved on the app for quick reference.

## Examples

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- ReactJS
- React Router
- Material-Ui

## Features

- Users can sign up and log in
- Users can create edit and delete code shares
- Users can upload images of what the code does

## Unsolved Problems

- There is a bug if the user first logs in and goes to the create code page, then if the user changes back to the home screen using the navigation bar the sign up modal turns back on even though sign up was not clicked. I believe this has something to do with the material-ui used on that page.
